How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

My specific approach to testing entails maintaining unit tests for each new class created.  These then are followed by integration tests that are either automatically or manually performed.  This ensures that I keep a large percentage of the code covered under various testing methods.  I have professional experience working with Junit and production level testing.  I believe that my testing in this course was sound.  In the source project I manually created mock objects in each of the classes that required object creations between lines 3-10.  Subsequently, this provides software developers with a more disciplined approach to testing.  There are many great resources on the test first approach and using software packages like Junit and Mockito to achieve complete code coverage.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Typically there in production environments there is a product owner or principal engineer that handles this task and designates subsequent requirements to his/her team.  I interpret user needs by reviewing with them on basic components first and then branching to advanced functionality requirements.  I'd take thorough notes and have regular check ins to explicitly define everything they want and what the user requires.

How do I approach designing software?
I try my best to take a test first approach to designing software.  I typically write out the design and its basic functionality on paper first, then move to writing tests, then functionality.
